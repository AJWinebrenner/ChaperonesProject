# Java-Chaperones Back-end project
Java chaperones including Robyn, Andrew, Alimaa and Adib

# Description: 

This is an API using java that stores activities available in London. Users can book themselves on to activities which guides run. 
We have 4 packages for guides, activities, users and venues. Guides and venues are assigned to activities, which users can book on to. All packages can perform basic CRUD functions. Some specialist functions include using the join table, bookings to filter the activities that are cancelled and active. Returning all a user's bookings. Returning all a guide's assigned activities. Removing a user from a booking. 

Technologies used for this were Spring boot, Java, and postgresQL. postico and postman were used for testing and development.  

This project was motivated by a desire to have in-person social activities, aiming to provide inspiration.
